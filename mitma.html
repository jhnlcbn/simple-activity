        <h1>MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK</h1>
        <p>A main function of any mobile device is communications. But not all mobile communications are secure and private. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can listen in, or even alter the traffic going to and from a mobile device. The most common way for this to happen is over public, unsecured WiFI networks.</p>

        <p>There are <span class="red">hundreds of millions of WiFi networks around the world </span>of which <span class="red">almost 1/3 are either unsecured or poorly secured.</span> It is easy for a cyber criminal to setup a fake WiFi hotspot (honeypot), then intercept and manipulate the stream of data. Even the most secure WiFi network is attackable. in late 2017, there was a lot of buzz about <span class="red">KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack)</span> which exploited a serious weakness in the WPA2 protocol used to secure WiFi networks. KRACK could be used to steal usernames, passwords and other sensitive corporate content.</p>

        <p>Other network types are equally at risk. <span class="red">Cyber criminals (and law enforcement) can use fake cellphone towers (aka stingrays)</span> to spoof 2G/3G/4G connections. In addition, most modern mobile devices running Android, IOS, Linux and Windows can be<span class="red">attacked through Bluetooth,</span> In both situations, the device data stream is compromised and malware can be introduced.</p>
