        <h1>PHISHING / SOCIAL ENGINEERING</h1>
        <p>An up and coming concern for corporate security is the growing 
            threat of <span class="red">social engineering</span> and phishing attacks. Phishing attacks 
            are easier to create and require less skill than coding Trojans. 
            They rely on human nature rather than on sophisticated code. 
            This explains why globally the <span class="red">number of phishing attacks has 
            increased by 65% in a single year.</span>
        </p>

        <p>Smart criminals are leveraging personal information they have 
            acquired illegally to improve the effectiveness of phishing attacks 
            against individual targets (spear phishing). It is easy to see why 
            a majority of surveyed business professionals consider <span class="red">phishing/ 
            spear phishing and social engineering as their top security concern.</span> 
            No matter how careful the IT department is, a misguided employee 
            can easily circumvent any preventative measures and make the 
            corporate network vulnerable to criminal activity.
