        <h1>IOT SECURITY</h1>
        <p>If scale and complexity are significant contributors to mobile security risk, then
            the Internet of Things (IOT) multiplies that risk a thousand-fold. As the IoT ramps up, so does
            the need to secure and manage the endpoints. Experts forecast that <span class="red">over 23 billion
            connected 'Things' will be in use by 2018, trippling to more than 75 billion by 2025.
            </span>That's 75 billion endpoints delivering essential functionality at the edge of your
            network - sensors, actuators, printers, scanners, wearables and robots, as well as a many
            more 'things' that we don't even know about yet.</p>
        <p>Historically, IoT devices have had poor security and are attractive targets for
            cyber criminals. In late 2016, hackers compromised thousands of poorly secured IoT
            endpoints to create a botnet that <span class="red">executed a massic DDoS attack on a key part of the
            internet infrastructure. </span>This was only the first of many large cyber attacks that used
            IoT devices as the attack vector.</p>

            <td class="column2">Because they are at the edge of your network and often unaattended, IoT

            Having visibility into these endpints in your EMM solution will give you the ability to secure
            and manage them throughout their full lifecycle, from deployment to retirement.</td>
