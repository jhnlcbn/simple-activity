        <h1>MALWARE</h1>
        <p>Historically, malware has been a greater threat to desktop and 
            laptop PCs than mobile devices. However, because mobile 
            devices are becoming more powerful and ubiquitous, <span class="red">mobile 
                malware is growing at six times the rate of desktop malware.</span></p>

        <p>Malware is the catch-all term for dozens different types of 
            potentially harmful applications (PHA). The most common are:</p>
    
        <p><span class="blue">Trojan:</span> A type of malware that hides as something else such as 
            a legitimate piece of software. Once a Trojan has been installed, 
            many things can happen, opening a backdoor, rooting/ 
            Jailbreaking, keylogging/spying, and spreading botnets for DDoS 
            attacks</p>

        <p><span class="blue">Ransomware:</span> it can be the effect of a Trojan, phishing or 
            hacking, but the result is the same. An external user takes over 
            and locks down something you need, whether it's important 
            data or a critical system. You are then required to pay money,
            usually in the form of untraceable Bitcoins, to unlock your data 
            and resume normal operations. <span class="red">Mobile ransomware is one of the 
            fastest-growing categories of malware,</span> increasing by a factor 
            of 3.5 between late 2016 and early 2017.
        </p>
        <p><span class="blue">Adware / Clickware:</span> There is a "less evil category of malware 
            that acts to generate revenue by secretly clicking on banners 
            from paid ads. <span class="red">In 2017, a malware codenamed "Judy"</span> was 
            found in several Korean games. It is estimated to have been 
            downloaded more than 10 million times and at its peak was 
            generating over $300k per month in ad revenue.</p>
