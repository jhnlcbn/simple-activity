        <h1>LOST OR STOLEN DEVICES</h1>
        <p>The most basic threat to physical device security is also the most common, loss or theft. Biometrics and kill-switches are reducing the incidence of mobile device theft, but still tens of millions of smartphones are lost or stolen every year. Once a laptop, tablet or smartphone is in the hands of a determined criminal, given enough time, a data breach is almost assured. From 2005 to 2015, <span class="red">more than 41% of all data broaches were the result of lost or stolen mobile devices</span> (laptops, smartphones and USB drives).</p>
