    <h1>BYOD</h1>
    <p>The growing trend of bring-your-own devices (BYOD) is both 
        a boon and a bane to business. On the plus side, BYOD can 
        save a company money and keep workers happier and more 
        productive, it lets employees keep in touch with their friends and 
        family throughout the workday via messaging and social media. 
        With all of these benefits, it is no wonder that industry experts 
        are projecting that the <span class="red">global BYOD market will reach $366 
            billion (USD) by 2020,</span> up from $30 billion (USD) in 2014.
    </p>

    <p>The negative side of BYOD is security. For IT managers, <span class="red">mobile 
        devices are already considered the weakest link for corporate 
        security,</span> unmanaged or uncontrolled devices just make it worse. 
        They show an increased likelihood to suffer all the threats 
        previously identified. More malware, more phishing and more 
        data leakage. The only security threat that decreases is lost or 
        stolen devices. People tend to take care of their own devices 
        better than work devices. Especially when they are on the hook 
        for a replacement.
